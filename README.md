<b> Experiment|     <b> To calibrate the given ammeter and voltmeter by potentiometer

### About the Experiment 

Calibration of voltmeter and ammeter using a potentiometer involves adjusting the device so that it accurately measures voltage and current. Here's the general process for each:

Calibration of Voltmeter: <br>

1.Connect the voltmeter in parallel with the potentiometer.<br>
2.Adjust the potentiometer until the voltmeter reads a known value.<br>
3.Repeat the process for a range of values to ensure accuracy over the full range of the voltmeter.<br>
  
Calibration of Ammeter:<br>

1.Connect the ammeter in series with the potentiometer.<br>
2.Adjust the potentiometer until the ammeter reads a known value.<br>
3.Repeat the process for a range of values to ensure accuracy over the full range of the ammeter.<br>
  
Note: Calibration should be performed by experienced technicians and with proper safety precautions.
